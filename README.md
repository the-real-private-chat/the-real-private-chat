# the real private chat

We want to build a real private chat, maybe unhackable?

### Why?
Messengers today try to be secure but are always connected to the internet. We want to build a messenger that is not connected to the internet and should be easy to use.


### How?
You need to have two Phones to make this messenger work. One Phone connected to the Internet where you can share your decrypted message and one Phone that is not connected to the Internet where you can decrypted and read the message.
